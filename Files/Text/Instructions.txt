Story: Far, far into the future, space travel has become integral to 
human civilization. People have spread out to far reaches of the cosmos, 
beyond the limits of planet Earth. However, an evil alien force has 
arrived! They are laying down countless blocks to prevent 
space-travellers from returning to Earth. You, as the saviour of 
humanity, must prevent these aliens from achieving their objective.

Objective and Mechanics of Tetris: You will be given different groups of blocks 
called tetrominoes. These tetrominoes will slowly fall to the bottom of a grid, 
accumulate, and stack on top of each other. Your objective is to arrange the 
tetrominoes so that they form rows filled with blocks. Once a row is filled, 
you earn points, and all blocks within that row are destroyed. You lose the 
game if the blocks accumulate all the way to the top of the grid.
